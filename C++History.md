## A Brief History of C++

#### Overview
C++ is an object-oriented programming language that combines low-level and high-level language.
It was created and developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. The operating systems
Windows and Linux are both written in C++.

#### 1979
In 1979 Stroustrup recieved his PhD in computer science from the University of Cambridge. He also
started his career at the Computer Science Research Center of Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey.
This year also marks the beginning of the creation of C++, inspired by features of the Simula 
simulation languages and the struggles of using C in his PhD experience. 

#### C with Classes
Stroustrup wanted to make improvements to C because it was fast and widely used. Originally, "C with
Classes" was developed and added classes, strong typing, inlining, and default arguments to the C
compiler. 

By 1982 C++ began development as the grandchild of C with Classes. There were many improvments
including references, memory allocation, and single line comments with forward slashes.
Cfront, the first standalone compiler for C++, was also created.

The first edition of *The C++ Programming Language* was released in 1985, and C++ was commercially
avaliable for use that October. There have been many updates to the language since including it's
standardization in 1998, and most recently C++20 which was published in December of 2020.

#### Today
According to the [September 2022 TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) C++ remains the fourth most popular programming language 
in the world (behind Python, Java, and C). Some familiar applications and systems that are developed in 
C++ are Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome browser, Maya 3D software,
and MySQL server.
